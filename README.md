Hello,

Hi, Iâ€™m Joanna!

Java was my first and favorite programming language â€” thatâ€™s where my coding journey began. I enjoy digging into its details and always learning something new. What excites me the most is working in a team where itâ€™s not just about writing code but about solving problems together and coming up with cool, innovative solutions.

Iâ€™m a fast learner and love tackling challenging problems â€” finding solutions is something I genuinely enjoy. Iâ€™m looking for a place where I can grow alongside experienced people while also bringing my own contributions by writing clean and efficient code.

I care about improving not only my technical skills but also how I collaborate and build a positive team vibe. 

Here's to the exciting journey ahead!</p><p align='left'>
